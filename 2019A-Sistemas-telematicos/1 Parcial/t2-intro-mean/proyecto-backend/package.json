Users will\r be the main thing we will focus on when building this API and in a few chapters, Angular will build\r the frontend views that will access our Users API.\r Let’s build an API that will:\r - Handle CRUD for an item (users)\r - Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/users and http://example.com/api/users/:user_-id)\r - Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)\r - Return JSON data\r - Log all requests to the console",
